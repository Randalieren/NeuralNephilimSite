                    <p>”You” and “your” pertains to you, the commissioner, trader, or requester, and “I”, "my", 
                        and “me” pertains to CRYPTIID CRUXX (i.e Timothy Bain).
                
                    By buying works from CRYPTIID CRUXX, you <em>automatically</em> adhere to my Terms of Service. 
                    When ordering things from me, please come prepared with references or collages of references with 
                    descriptions so I know exactly what you want, please.</p>

                    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>

                    <p>When purchasing from me, it’s expected that you pay <em>up front</em>. Of course, if you cannot,
                         that is fine, but HD images will not be released to you and will be heavily watermarked 
                         (if at all released to you) until payment is fulfilled to avoid scamming. If you cannot pay 
                         in full, then a payment plan can be arranged where 50% of the payment is given to me so I can 
                         at least start on the commission.</p>

                    <h2>REFUNDS, REVISIONS, AND COMPLEXITY FEES</h2>

                    <p>To file a refund, it must be done within the time the sketch is being drawn. As soon as it’s 
                        on the lining stage, refunds will not be accepted <em>UNLESS</em> I express that I cannot 
                        complete the commission. In addition to that, you cannot use any of the sketches or linework 
                        once the refund is processed; the process images will be promptly deleted and you are not 
                        allowed to use the artwork despite it being your character.</p>

                    <p>For revisions, I can revise as many times needed as long as it’s possible and depends on 
                        where it is in the stage. If revisions need to be made after the work was completed, you 
                        must tell me within 7 days of completion.</p>

                    <p>For major design revisions in a current commission (major change of pose, character design, 
                        or multiple variant changes), I may charge a revision fee of $10-$15. This fee would be 
                        prompted if and only if a major change is requested during the lining stage. Each instance 
                        will be charged ONLY, not charging per change. Revisions of 100% of the image are not covered 
                        under this, you must order a new piece if you want a do over.</p>

                    <p>For complexity fees, this applies if the character that I am drawing has, but is not limited 
                        to: over 4 types of markings, more than 3 extra appendages (appendages count as arms, legs, 
                        wings, eyes, etc.), multiple colors on base design (on body), and/or complex clothing and 
                        accessories. Complexity will be determined by me only.</p>

                    <h2>POSTING MY WORK ELSEWHERE</h2>

                    <p>You are entitled to use the work however you please for profile pictures, social media, 
                        banners, etc. as long as it’s not for monetary gain unless you arrange to get explicit 
                        permission from me. The commissioned work is yours and only yours and whoever else's 
                        character is in the artwork, meaning you <em>cannot</em> give others explicit permission 
                        to freely use it without my permission as it is my intellectual property.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you post it on other sites, you need to:
                    <span>1. Keep the watermark in tact; you are not allowed to erase any watermarks or signatures 
                        by me, and</span>
                    <span>2. If posting elsewhere, please credit me and link any of my social media pages listed 
                        on this site in your media.</span></p>

                    <h2>COPYRIGHT INFORMATION, USE OF CHARACTERS, AND USE OF ART</h2>

                    <p>You are prohibited from reselling, tracing, editing, and using my images for monetary gain 
                        without my explicit permission.
                    All intellectual property (including art, animations, characters, etc.) produced by CRYPTIID 
                    CRUXX are not to be used for commercial/monetization purposes without my permission. This 
                    includes, but is not limited to any art or characters made by me in:
                
                    <span>• videos</span>
                    <span>• movies</span>

                    <span>• websites</span>
                    <span>• or on any type of clothing or apparel.</span></p>
                    
                    <p>For use of my characters and artwork, you may use them for <em>non-commercial</em> purposes 
                        if you me first and credit me by linking any of my social media pages listed on this site 
                        to your media. This includes, but is not limited to:
                
                    <span>• videos</span>
                    <span>• fanart*</span>
                    <span>• movies</span>
                    <span>• video games</span>
                    <span>• websites and journal articles (physical and electronic)</span>
                    <span>• or in parodies</span></p>
                    
                    <p>However, my artwork and characters are not to be used to push any sort of political rhetoric 
                        without my permission, along with promoting hate-speech as it is not a representation of any 
                        of my personal values.</p>
                
                    <p id="emphasize"><em>*If you are using fanart that contains my characters but is made by someone 
                        else other than me, potential permission must be obtained by that artist, and credit must be 
                        given to all parties, including me since I own the character(s).Characters that do not belong
                         to me in my artwork (such as commission work, gift art, art trades, etc.) belong to their 
                         respective owners.</em></p>

                    <h2>"CUSTOMER TOS"</h2>

                    <p>My Terms of Service (TOS) overrides a “customer TOS” as I am the one offering a service in 
                        exchange of money. You are not allowed to change around the set permissions in my service 
                        as it is backed by U.S. Copyright law. A “customer TOS” does not override what I do with 
                        sketches, artwork, and other intellectual property created by me.
                    </p>

                    <h2>SELF-ADVERTISEMENT AND MY PERSONAL USAGE</h2>

                    <p>Intellectual property created by me can be used by me in any form of reference, examples, 
                        and design for the purpose of showcasing and self-advertisement. Although these are my 
                        works of art, any characters that I do not own that are drawn by me will be credited to 
                        their appropriate owner(s) as I own the intellectual property but not the character.

                    Please know that this applies to all exchanges of art (I.e. commissions, auctions, trades, 
                    requests, etc.)</p>
                
                    <h2>TLDR;</h2>
                    
                    <p>Pay me up front. If you want to arrange a payment plan, ask. No refunds after the sketch 
                        is completed. If I refunded you, do not use any sketchwork I sent you. Revisions need to 
                        be done before the 7 day mark after completion, major changes will get you charged. You 
                        can use your gifted or purchased art from me on your social media, just credit me. Yes, 
                        you can use my OCs in fan art, animations, etc., just credit me and ask if you're using 
                        it in other media like games or something. <em>No,</em> you cannot make money off my 
                        artwork without my knowledge, or we will fight. If it's my artwork, I'll use it how I 
                        see fit (with credit for your characters), and lastly, don't use my characters or artwork 
                        in political stuff. <em>No, my characters will not support your hate campaign.</em></p>
