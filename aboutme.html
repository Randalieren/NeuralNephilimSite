        <p>Heyo! The name's Timothy Bain, but everyone knows me as CRYPTIID CRUXX, or CRUX. Pronouns are 
        they/them. I'm a black digital artist majoring in computer science, born and raised in Baltimore, MD. 
        I'm 21 years old and a college undergrad in my fourth year, and my goal is to pursue a career in full 
        stack web development while also pursuing game development on the side.
        My areas of of artisitc interest are fantasy based things such as mythology, demons, and 
        art and media featuring underrepresented groups such as people of color and LGBTQ. On the side, 
        I love to write stories, play games, draw (duh), and hang out with my friends. I also do enjoy a bit 
        of quiet time here and there.</p>
    
        <p>Oh, and I love cats. Specifically hairless cats. 
            If you would like to reach out to me, please contact me through DMs on my 
            listed social media, or shoot me an email at [insert email].</p>
