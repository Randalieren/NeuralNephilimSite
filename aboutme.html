        <h3>Heyo! The name's Timothy Bain, but everyone knows me as NEURAL NEPHILIM, or Neuro. Pronouns are he/him and they/them. I'm a black digital artist majoring in computer science, born and raised in Baltimore, MD. I'm 20 years old and a college undergrad in my fourth year, and my goal is to pursue a career in full stack web development while also pursuing game development on the side.<br><br>
            
        My areas of of artisitc interest are fantasy based things such as mythology, demons, and art and media featuring underrepresented groups such as people of color and LGBTQ. On the side, I love to write stories, play games, draw (duh), and hang out with my friends. I also do enjoy a bit of quiet time here and there.<br><br>
            
        Oh, and I love cats. Specifically hairless cats.<br><br><br>
