                <p>My areas of of artisitc interest are fantasy based things such as mythology, 
                demons, and art and media featuring underrepresented groups such as people of color and LGBTQ. On the side, I love to write stories, play games, draw (duh), and hang out with my friends. I also do enjoy a bit of quiet time here and there.</p>
